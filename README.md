## Overview
- This is my first ever challenge. The challenges is from Frontend Mentor https://www.frontendmentor.io which I coded spending about 10 hours on it. All the html raw text and related images provided by the Frontend Mentor and a design image of how the page looks on two different screen sizes. 

### The challenge
- The code is only created for screen sizes @375px and @1440px as it was the specific requirement by the Frontend Mentor. Therefore, it might look weird on other screen sizes; please take this into account.
